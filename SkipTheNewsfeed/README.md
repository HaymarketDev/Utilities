Chrome extension to let you skip the Facebook newsfeed and go straight to your profile.  Increasing your productivity, right?

To use the development version.

  *manifest.json
  *bg.html
  *skip_the_newsfeed.js
2) Go to the Chrome menu -> Tools -> Extensions or go to chrome://chrome/extensions/.
3) Click "Load Unpacked Extension..."
4) Select the folder where the files are
