This screensaver will randomly play videos (.mp4 and .wmv) in a folder.  Use the options screen to choose the location of the video files to play. The default location is C:\Users\Public\Videos.

If it can't find any playable files, it will try to play C:\Users\Public\Videos\Sample Videos\Wildlife.wmv.

To install it, drop the contents of output folder into your C:\Windows\SysWOW64 (or C:\Windows\System32) directory, set it as the screen saver, and change the video folder path in the options. 

The screen saver will stop when you move the mouse or hit the keyboard, except for these hotkeys:
B - Back
N - Next

. - Fast Forward
